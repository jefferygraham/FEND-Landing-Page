# Landing Page Project
## Purpose
This is a project for Udacity's [Front End Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011). The assignment was to implement a multi-section landing page that dynamically appended data to the DOM.
## Elements

 1. Navigation items are dynamically added to the navigation bar by querying the sections in the DOM
 2. To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed is differentiated by highlighting the section. 
 3. When a user clicks on a navigation item, the page scrolls to the appropriate section rather than the default jump.
